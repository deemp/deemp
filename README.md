### Dear fellow devs

This is a `Two Minute CV` with an Innopolis University BS'23 Danila Danko.

Today, we are going to look at what some of my projects are.

## Haskell ü§ì

* [try-phi](https://github.com/objectionary/try-phi) - an online interpreter of ùúë-calculus (WIP) and EO.

  * [Frontend](https://github.com/objectionary/try-phi/tree/main/front)
    * `PureScript` + `Bootstrap 5`
    * Editors - `Codemirror 6` + extensions written in `Typescript`
  * [Backend](https://github.com/objectionary/try-phi/tree/main/back)
    * `Haskell`
    * Parser - `Megaparsec`
      * [eo-parser](https://github.com/deemp/eo-utils) - a parser of [EO language](https://github.com/objectionary/eo). Provides a convenient annotated IR (with source mapping) closely resembling the grammar of ùúë-calculus. Used in `try-phi`
    * Server - `Servant`

* [clerk](https://github.com/deemp/clerk#readme) - declaratively generate spreadsheets

* [manager](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/manager#readme) - easily manage Haskell modules and template files. `Nix flake`

* [repohs](https://github.com/deemp/repohs#readme) - a script for concurrent fetching, unpacking and counting lines in multiple repositories.

* [nginx-clickhouse-hs](https://github.com/deemp/nginx-clickhouse-hs#readme) - parse nginx logs based on log format and prepare them for loading into a database.

* [–§–ü –Ω–∞ —è–∑—ã–∫–µ Haskell (—á–∞—Å—Ç—å 2)](https://stepik.org/cert/1492090) - a course on `Haskell` that I almost [finished](https://stepik.org/users/124553190).

* [br4ch1st0chr0n3](https://codeforces.com/submissions/brachistochrone) - several problems solved in `Haskell` on `Codeforces`

## Elm

* [elm-graph-editor](https://github.com/deemp/elm-graph-editor) - an interactive graph editor written in `Elm`.

## Nix flakes

* [codium-haskell](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/templates/codium/haskell#readme) - `Nix` flake template showing 5 ways to run a `Haskell` program

* [terrafix](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/terrafix#readme) - Generate `Terraform` files from DRY `Nix` expressions (`eDSL`)

* [lima](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/lima#readme) - convert between `Literate Haskell` (`.lhs`) and `Markdown` (`.md`)

* [flakes-tools](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/flake-tools) - scripts
  * Update `flake.lock`s in selected directories
  * Push them to [cachix](https://www.cachix.org/)

* [devops-labs](https://github.com/deemp/devops-labs) - `Nix` applications in `DevOps` tasks

* [codium](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/codium) - VSCodium with adjustable extensions and runtime dependencies

* [json2md](https://github.com/deemp/flakes/tree/main/json2md) - generate `README.md`-s from `JSON`

* [nix-managed](https://github.com/deemp/nix-managed) - `Haskell` IDE as a `Nix flake`

## Logic programming ü§Ø

* [Intro to AI Assignment](https://github.com/deemp/AI) - Find an optimal path in a grid maze via `SWI-Prolog`.

## OOP and GUI ü•∏

* [Ava-Day](https://github.com/RO-DIS/Ava-day) - Combines an image and path data (once generated by a genetic algorithm) to create a pseudo-3D avatar. Written using `PyQT6` and `Vispy`.

* [Computational Practicum](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/ComputationalPracticum) - An app (`PyQT5` + `pyqtgraph`) to plot [IVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem) solutions.

## Frontend experiments ü§ï

* [mini-games](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/mini-games) - For now, a calculator game written in `Typescript` + `Boostrap 5` for my sisters to practice arithmetical operations. Try [here](https://br4ch1st0chr0n3.github.io/mini-games/)

* [eo-editor](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/eo-editor) - An online editor for EO language featuring syntax highlighting, diagnostics, Lezer Tree printing in console, etc. `Codemirror 6` + `Typescript`

* [phi-editor](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/phi-editor) - An online editor for ùúë language featuring syntax highlighting, diagnostics, Lezer Tree printing in console, etc. `Codemirror 6` + `Typescript`

## Low-level ü§†

* [Sanitator](https://codeforces.com/profile/sanitator) - I solved around 1K problems on Codeforces in `C++`.

* [vforces](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/vforces) - Shows the solutions to some Codeforces problems in `V`. Also, includes the setup instructions for a simple project in [V language](https://github.com/vlang/v)
