### Dear fellow devs,

This is a `Two Minute CV` with Innopolis University BS'23 Danila Danko.

Today, we are going to look at what some of my interests are.

## Functional programming ü§ì

* [try-phi](https://github.com/objectionary/try-phi) - an online interpreter of ùúë-calculus (WIP) and EO.

  * Frontend
    * `PureScript` + `Bootstrap 5`
    * Editors - `Codemirror 6` + extensions written in `Typescript`
  * Backend
    * `Haskell`
    * Parser - `Megaparsec`

* [eo-parser](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/eo-utils) - a parser of [EO language](https://github.com/objectionary/eo). Provides a convenient annotated IR (with source mapping) closely resembling the grammar of ùúë-calculus. Written in `Haskell`, used in `try-phi`

* [repohs](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/repohs) - a `Haskell` script for concurrent fetching, unpacking and counting lines in multiple repositories.

* [nginx-clickhouse-hs](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/nginx-clickhouse-hs) - parse nginx logs based on log format and prepare them for loading into a database.

* [–§–ü –Ω–∞ —è–∑—ã–∫–µ Haskell (—á–∞—Å—Ç—å 2)](https://stepik.org/cert/1492090) - a course on `Haskell` that I almost [finished](https://stepik.org/users/124553190).

* [elm-graph-editor](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/elm-graph-editor) - an interactive graph editor written in `Elm`.

* [br4ch1st0chr0n3](https://codeforces.com/submissions/brachistochrone) - I solved several problems in `Haskell` on Codeforces.

## Nix

* [terrafix](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/terrafix) - a Nix eDSL. Allows to generate Terraform files from DRY Nix expressions
* [flakes](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes) includes
  * pinned inputs
  * flakes for tools that I use, like
    * [flake-tools](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/tree/main/flake-tools) contains a reusable script for pushing all flakes in a repo to [cachix](https://www.cachix.org/)
    * [codium](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/tree/main/codium) gives VSCodium with adjustable extensions and runtime dependencies
    * [packaged](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/flakes/tree/main/json2md) json2md - to generate `README.md`-s

## Logic programming ü§Ø

* [Intro to AI Assignment](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/AI) - Find an optimal path in a grid maze via `SWI-Prolog`.

## OOP and GUI ü•∏

* [Ava-Day](https://github.com/RO-DIS/Ava-day) - Combines an image and path data (once generated by a genetic algorithm) to create a pseudo-3D avatar. Written using `PyQT6` and `Vispy`.

* [Computational Practicum](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/ComputationalPracticum) - An app (`PyQT5` + `pyqtgraph`) to plot [IVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_value_problem) solutions.

## Frontend experiments ü§ï

* [mini-games](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/mini-games) - For now, a calculator game written in `Typescript` + `Boostrap 5` for my sisters to practice arithmetical operations. Try [here](https://br4ch1st0chr0n3.github.io/mini-games/)

* [eo-editor](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/eo-editor) - An online editor for EO language featuring syntax highlighting, diagnostics, Lezer Tree printing in console, etc. `Codemirror 6` + `Typescript`

* [phi-editor](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/phi-editor) - An online editor for ùúë language featuring syntax highlighting, diagnostics, Lezer Tree printing in console, etc. `Codemirror 6` + `Typescript`

## Low-level ü§†

* [Sanitator](https://codeforces.com/profile/sanitator) - I solved around 1K problems on Codeforces in `C++`.

* [vforces](https://github.com/br4ch1st0chr0n3/vforces) - Shows the solutions to some Codeforces problems in `V`. Also, includes the setup instructions for a simple project in [V language](https://github.com/vlang/v)
